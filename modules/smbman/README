To allow using user security mode, with LM auth on my Samba server,
I've changed the followind settings in my /etc/samba/smb.conf file:

security = user
lanman auth = yes
encrypt passwords = yes

"encrypt passwords" can be set to no to send PlainText passwords.

After that, you need to add a user and set his password:
> sudo smbpasswd -a your_user

CAREFUL: once you change the "lanman auth" setting, it seems you need
to update you passwords with smbpasswd.
