Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open USB Loader is a 100% Open source game loader compatible with 
USB Advance/Extreme game format. It's more compatible and it should work
without ps2load or change DNASXXX.IMG tricks.

Open USB Loader also is developed continuously and anyone can contribute 
improvements to the project.

The main objective is to support both the PS2 and the PS3 with backward 
compatibility.

There are compatibility lists in the project repository:

How to use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, you need an USB device compatible with PS2/PS3 formatted in FAT32.
The games have to be in USB Advance/Extreme format. There are some programs
for converting games to this format. Open USB Loader includes an command line
tool for that purpose called iso2usbld.

Other utilities are: USBUtil 2.0, USB Extreme installer or USB Insane.

In PS2 you can use any of the existing methods for loading an executable elf.

In PS3 you need to have an original SwapMagic 3.6+ or 3.8 (at the moment
there aren't any other option).

The steps for loading Open USB Loader in a PS3 are:

    1. Rename OpenUSBLD.ELF to SMBOOT0.ELF
	2. Make a folder in root of USB device called SWAPMAGIC and copy 
	   SMBOOT0.ELF to it.
	3. Launch SwapMagic in PS3 and press UP+L1 then Open USB Loader should
	   start.
	   
There are 4 forms for launching elfs in SwapMagic.

SMBOOT0.ELF = UP + L1
SMBOOT1.ELF = UP + L2
SMBOOT2.ELF = UP + R1
SMBOOT3.ELF = UP + R2

Some notes for devs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open USB Loader needs an actual version of GSKit and an updated PS2SDK with
latest patch in libpatches.
